Like in the case of most trades, middlemen exploit the fishermen. To add to the woes of the poor, natural calamities like cyclones also affect their lives negatively. They rely on a Jetty (dock) to keep their boats from sinking. However, in order to get a Jetty, they have to go through a lot of hardship.

Meanwhile, the antagonist (Mime Gopi) has his own self-interest in preventing a Jetty from coming up. Amidst all this, Jalayya's daughter Meenakshi (Nandita Swetha) and her lover Sriram (Maanyam Krishna), who is a school teacher, have a stake.",
